    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Pablo and I am from Salta Argentina. I am married to Soledad and we have three children, Jaasiel the older one, Elias the middle, and Aar√≥n the younger one. </p>
    <p>I have been a member for 21 years. I was baptized when I was 23 years old and after that, I served a mission in Provo Utah between 2005 and 2007.</p>
    <p>Actually, I am working as a high counselor on the Salta Oeste Stake. We have a lot of work to do but the blessings are a lot too.</p>
    <p>About my job, I am in administrative management at a business company but I love programming, so that is one reason why I am studying at BYUI.</p>
